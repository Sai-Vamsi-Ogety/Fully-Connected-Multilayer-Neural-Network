Experiment to see how training and test accuracy varies with number of iterations and how Learning rate varies with number of iterations and  finally select the model which gives the best accuracy

Database Used: MNIST

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
